One time an aquantance said something along the lines of "I could capture the last card in [東方永夜抄 ～ Imperishable Night](http://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Imperishable_Night)'s spellcard practice mode if Youmu's ghost half stopped distracting me". This was my attempt to help him out. He managed to do it, but I don't think this really helped him that much. 

Requires version 1.00d.

Compliation
----------------

You will need the DirectX SDK.

Usage
----------------

Just place d3d8.dll in the same directory as the game.
